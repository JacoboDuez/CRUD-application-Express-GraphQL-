# CRUD-application-Express-GraphQL-
This application was part of the M.I.T course, I created an restaurant object with several properties (naming,description,dishes and pricing of the dishes) and then all the queries to obtain the data, modify it, add new restaurants and delete if needed with the help of javascript, express and graphql.
